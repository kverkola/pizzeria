        Pizza (Italian pronunciation: ['pittsa]) is an oven-baked, flat, round bread typically
        topped with a tomato sauce, cheese and various toppings. The modern pizza was invented
        in Naples, Italy, and the dish has since become popular in many parts of the world.
        An establishment that makes and sells pizzas is called a "pizzeria". Many varieties of
        pizza exist worldwide, along with several dish variants based upon pizza. Pizza is cooked
        in various types of ovens, and a diverse variety of ingredients and toppings are utilized.
        In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was safeguarded in the European Union as a
        Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish.
